# arty-a7-100-base

Embedded Project Oberon v8.0 base system.

It works with the stock SD card image file as provided with Astrobe for RISC5 v 8.0.0.

The Vivado project in directory 'build' creates the FPGA configuration files using the Verilog sources in /lib-base/fpga.
'RISC5Top.v' and 'ArtyA7-100.xdc' are from the local 'lib' directory.

## Projects and Systems

Each project directory contains all changed and added Oberon and Verilog modules for a specific system, with the original, unchanged ones in 'lib-base'. There's an additional README file inside each directory with further information.

### lib-base

The baseline Oberon and Verilog modules.

### arty-a7-100-base

The Verilog modules to build the base Embedded Project Oberon v8.0 system for the Digilent Arty A7-100.

### arty-a7-100-calltrace

The Oberon and Verilog modules to build the system with the Calltrace feature for the Digilent Arty A7-100.

See [Stack Trace](https://www.astrobe.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=747) in the Astrobe forum.

### cv-sk-base

The Verilog modules to build the base Embedded Project Oberon v8.0 system for the Terasic Cyclone V GX Starter Kit.

It boots the stock SD card image file as provided with Astrobe for RISC5 8.0.
